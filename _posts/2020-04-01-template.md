This is a blog post about the ICLR2021 paper:

Leaning on the success of deep neural networks on images, texts, and audios, graph neural networks (GNN) have been an active area of machine learning research to tackle various problems in graph data. Graph is a power way of representing relationships among entities as nodes connected by edges. Nodes and edges can have features on them for GNN to learn from. GNN typically reasons among neighboring nodes to by exchanging messages between them to update node representations with node and edge features, thus integrating the topological structures of the graph when making inferences. 

Message function:
$$
\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{m}_{ij} = M(\mathbf{h}_i, \mathbf{h}_j, \mathbf{h}_{ij})    
\end{equation}
$$

Update function:
$$
\begin{equation}
    h_{i} \leftarrow U(\mathbf{h}_i, \sum_{j\in \mathcal{N}(i)}\mathbf{m}_{ij} )
\end{equation}
$$

Sometimes nodes and edges can have spatial features, such as 3D coordinates of nodes and directions along edges, adding a layer of geometric relationships among the entities. We term this type of graph with vector features on nodes and/or edges as **geometric graph** in this post. Small molecules, macro-molecules, and geospatial data are all examples where one can construct geometric graphs: small molecules can be represented by a graph of atoms connected by chemical bonds, where atoms can be described by their coordinates in 3D Euclidean space and chemical bonds can be described by vectors along their directions. The angles between adjacent chemical bonds are known to be indicative of the chemical properties of the molecule such as stability. Similarly, macro-molecules such as proteins can be represented by a graph of amino acid residues connected by their spatial proximity. Each amino acid residues contain $k$ atoms, making the node vector features $\mathbf{V}_n \in \mathbb{R}^{k \times 3}$,
